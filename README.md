DEPRECATED SARL Demos (DO NOT USE)
==================================

This is the set of demos for SARL.

SARL is a general-purpose agent-oriented language.

SARL aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration. 
These high-level features are now considered as the major requirements for an easy and practical implementation of modern complex software applications. 
We are convinced that the agent-oriented paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.

Considering the variety of existing approaches and meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach remains as generic as possible and highly extensible to easily integrate new concepts and features. The language is platform- and architecture-independent. 

However, we provide a first set of tools to support its execution based on the new version 2.0 of the Janus (see http://www.janusproject.io) platform, but it can be linked with other existing agent platforms and frameworks. 

Launching the Demos
===================

Each demo in the `src` folder is associated to a README file
that explains the principle of the demo, and how to run it.
