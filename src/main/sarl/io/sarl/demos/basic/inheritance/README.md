DEPRECATED Demo: Inheritance Example (Do not use)
=================================================

## Principle of the Demo

The agent is displaying "Hello World in the child agent!".
After 2 seconds, it is displaying "Kill myself" and 
is commiting a suicide.

The launched agent is inheriting a part of his behavior from
a super agent.

You need to compile the demo with Maven. Type on the command
line:

> mvn clean package
