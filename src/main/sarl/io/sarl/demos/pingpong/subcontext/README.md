DEPRECATED Tutorial: Agent Communication in Subcontext (Do not use)
===================================================================

## Principle of the Demo

The principle of the application is the following:

* The Ping agent is sending a Ping message to all agents in a specific space.
* The Pong agent is receiving the Ping message, and replies with a Pong message to the sender of the Ping message.
* The Ping agent is receiving a Pong message and replies to the sender of the Pong with a new Ping message.

These messages contains an integer number that indicates the number of the event.

The messages are exchanged into the default space of a subcontext.
