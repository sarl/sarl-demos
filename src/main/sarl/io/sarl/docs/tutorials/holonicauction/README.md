DEPRECATED Tutorial: Holonic Auction (Do not use)
=================================================

## Principle of the Demo

The principle of the application is the following:

* The super-agent creates 3 sub-agents that are computing an integer number.
* After the sub-agents have given their numbers to the super-agent, this last is displaying the ID of the agent that has win (with the higher number).
   
By a design choice, the players are the sub-agents.

line:
